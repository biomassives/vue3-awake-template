# Eco Ops WorldBridger One: Architecture and Planning

This document outlines the proposed architecture for the Eco Ops WorldBridger One platform, focusing on key components and their interactions.

## Overview

Eco Ops WorldBridger One aims to provide a decentralized and scalable platform for managing the "eco ops metadata standard." The architecture incorporates various technologies to achieve this goal, including: Decentralized Metadata Management

Overview

This document outlines the proposed architecture for managing metadata within the Eco Ops WorldBridger One ecosystem. The system aims to be decentralized, secure, and scalable to accommodate the growing needs of the project.

Components

    Supabase
        Core Database: Utilizes Supabase's Postgres database for storing essential metadata and user information.
        User Management: Leverages Supabase Auth, potentially enhanced with BASEjump, for user authentication and authorization.
        Row Level Security (RLS): Implements RLS to control access to metadata based on user roles (NFT owners, dashboard users, administrators).
        Storage: Potentially uses Supabase Storage for backups of Google Docs and other critical files.

    Vercel
        Frontend Deployment: Deploys the VuePress "hope" site and other frontend applications on Vercel for optimal performance and scalability.
        API Endpoints: Hosts serverless functions on Vercel to provide API endpoints for frontend interactions and external integrations.
        Login Modules: Creates and hosts customizable login modules as serverless functions for easy integration with websites using the Eco Ops metadata standard.

    Google Docs
        Metadata Storage: Utilizes Google Docs as a collaborative platform for creating and managing certain types of metadata.
        Backups: Implements automated backups of Google Docs to Supabase Storage for data redundancy and security.

    DigitalOcean
        Backend Services: Hosts backend services on DigitalOcean droplets for specific needs and technology requirements (Django, Rust, Elixir, Node.js).
        NFT Ownership Tracking: Runs the core logic for tracking NFT ownership and managing associated metadata on DigitalOcean servers.
        API Integration: Exposes API endpoints from DigitalOcean servers for communication with the frontend and other components.

Data Flow and Interactions

    Users: Interact with the VuePress "hope" site and other frontend applications for accessing information, managing their NFTs, and utilizing platform features.
    Frontend: Communicates with API endpoints on Vercel and DigitalOcean to fetch and update data, authenticate users, and integrate with external services.
    Vercel: Handles frontend deployments, API requests, and serverless functions for login modules and other integrations.
    Supabase: Stores core metadata, user data, and backups, enforces access control with RLS, and provides a real-time data layer for certain applications.
    DigitalOcean: Hosts backend services for specific functionalities, including NFT ownership tracking and API endpoints for data-intensive operations.
    Google Docs: Serves as a collaborative platform for metadata creation and management, with automated backups to Supabase for data security.

Key Considerations

    Decentralization: The architecture promotes decentralization by distributing data and processing across different platforms and services.
    Security: Emphasizes security at every level, including user authentication, data access control, and secure backups.
    Scalability: Designed to be scalable to accommodate the growth of the Eco Ops WorldBridger One ecosystem.
    Interoperability: Ensures seamless communication and data exchange between different components through well-defined APIs and data synchronization mechanisms.

Future Enhancements

    Enhanced Decentralization: Explore further decentralization options, such as integrating IPFS or blockchain technologies for metadata storage and management.
    Advanced Analytics: Develop advanced analytics dashboards and reporting capabilities to provide insights into metadata usage and trends.
    Integration with WorldBridger One: Deepen integration with WorldBridger One to streamline sub-release registration, data sharing, and other collaborative workflows.
