The `EcoOpsReport` is the heart of our transparency efforts.   When metadata inscribed images  are supplied to nft.storage, bit-torrent, pinata,  storj, and other self hosted systems, ensuring that this carbon credit style compensation model is transparent, and easily accessed.  Ecocity.com supplies a verification list, of CID's for persistent IPFS objects, so that verifying a project you may be considering volunteering, making a loan, or or donation recipients to can be verified.
