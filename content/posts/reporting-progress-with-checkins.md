How it works: ‘eco ops app’ generates reports supporting group transparency showing what activities are planned, milestones achieved, and credits participants by awarding climate friendly NFT tokens to participants, which are used to substantiate the sale of credits to the general public and corporate sponsors. SCD Hub is a US non profit founded in 2017 dedicated to researching and educating about the efficacy of local actions that can be taken to address global climate and biodiversity issues in a locally appropriate context  



## Eco Ops Reporting API

A metadata standard for each type of activity inclusive of existing carbon credit paradigm, and projected methodologies in more ecosystem viability focused efforts.  like so: 

```

## Pretty Stinkin' Fast, I'd Say

I've taken a number of steps to try and make Awake as fast and snappy as possible for the end user and I think you'll find it's been handled fairly well. Last I ran one of the posts through Page Speed Insights I got a 99 score for desktop and 89 for mobile. [Give it a try for yourself!](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fawake-template.netlify.com%2Fpost-markup-and-formatting%2F&tab=desktop)
