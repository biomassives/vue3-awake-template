Awake is fast for a couple different reasons. It both capitalizes on the platform it's built for (JAM Stack) and the framework it's built on (Nuxt.js) as well as includes some intentional optimizations to improve the end user experience when it comes to speed. 

## Eco Ops Reporting API

A metadata standard for each type of activity inclusive of existing carbon credit paradigm, and projected methodologies in more ecosystem viability focused efforts.  like so: 

```
 icons: ['faTimes', 'faSearch', 'faEnvelope', 'faUser', 'faBriefcase']
```

## Report Format

In ogrids are lazy loaded with infinite scroll and all images (feature images and those in posts) are also lazy loaded. Comments can be lazy loaded or loaded on click of "Show Comments" button.

## Pretty Stinkin' Fast, I'd Say

I've taken a number of steps to try and make Awake as fast and snappy as possible for the end user and I think you'll find it's been handled fairly well. Last I ran one of the posts through Page Speed Insights I got a 99 score for desktop and 89 for mobile. [Give it a try for yourself!](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fawake-template.netlify.com%2Fpost-markup-and-formatting%2F&tab=desktop)
